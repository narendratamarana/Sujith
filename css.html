			<h1> The top 4 are: star, universe, nebula and cosmos. You can get the definition(s) of a word in the list below by tapping the question-mark icon next to it. The words at the top of the list are the ones most associated with galaxy, and as you go down the relatedness becomes more slight. By default, the words are sorted by relevance/relatedness, but you can also get the most common galaxy terms by using the menu below, and there's also the option to sort the words alphabetically so you can get galaxy words starting with a particular letter. You can also filter the word list so it only shows words that are also related to another word of your choosing. So for example, you could enter "star" and click "filter", and it'd give you words that are related to galaxy and star.
